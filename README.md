## Downloading Attendance management System

1. Create a new, empty folder called opensource/ in your computer's home folder.
2. Navigate to it (`cd opensource`), then fork and clone the ams repo so that it gets downloaded into opensource/ams.
3. Navigate to this folder (`cd ams`) and run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/codethechange-niec/ams.git` (or, if you're using SSH, use `git@github.com:codethechange-niec/ams.git`) to add an upstream remote that's linked to ams's main repository. (This will be necessary when submitting PRs later.)
